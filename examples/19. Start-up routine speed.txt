Speed at which LEDs are changing states one-by-one on startup is configurable.

*40mS:
F0 00 53 43 01 00 01 00 04 04 F7

*60mS:
F0 00 53 43 01 00 01 00 04 06 F7

*100mS:
F0 00 53 43 01 00 01 00 04 0A F7

Excepted parameters are 1-120 (0x01-0x78). Parameter is multiplied by 10, ie. setting it to 15 (0x0F) will result in 150mS second blink time.
